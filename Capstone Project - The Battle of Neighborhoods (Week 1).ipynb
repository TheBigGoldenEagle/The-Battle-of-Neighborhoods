      "source": "The **Socrata Open Data API** will be used to fetch the data from the **City of Calgary's Open Data Portal and Citizenship Dashboard** and conver it to Pandas Dataframe. As a result, we will have three dataframes: the *Census by Community 2019* dataframe will include the community codes and names,the *Census by Community, Age and Gender* will contain the community codes, the population of 10 different age groups in each community and lastly the *Community Point* dataframe will have the geographical coordinate of the centroid of each community.  \n\nFirst, I will aggregate the *Census by Community, Age and Gender* dataframe into only 3 different age groups namely 0-18, 19-64 and 64+, then add up the population of all the genders in the 19-64 age group. Then, I will drop the non-residential communities. Then I will consolidate the resulted dataframe with the other two and drop all unneccessary columns. The remaining columns will be Community name, Population of 19-64, Latitude and Longitude \n\nSecond, I will use Foursquare API to find all the Liquore Stores within 3 Kilometers of the centroid of each community \n\nThird, I will use the **Folium library** to visulize the location of the liquor store in City of Calgary  \n\nForth, I will append my dataframe with a new column which represents the number of Liquore Stores within three kilometrs of the centroid of each community  \n\nFifth, I will devide the population of 19-64 by the number of the liquor stores in each community and add the result as a new column to our dataframe. The result numbers represent the number of people between 19 and 64 years old per liquor store in each community. Therefore the community corresponding with the biggest number is the most optimal community to open a new Liquor Store\n\n"
